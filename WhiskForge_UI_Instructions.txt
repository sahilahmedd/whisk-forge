You asked for a .txt file containing all the detailed UI/UX improvement instructions for your WhiskForge Python EXE UI. Below is the complete content exactly as provided in the chat, without omissions:

[START OF INSTRUCTIONS]
Nice — tasty UI to refine. Below is a full, production-ready implementation spec you can feed to your AI agent (or hand to a frontend dev) to upgrade the current Python `.exe` UI into a professional, usable, accessible, maintainable application. I include (1) high-level goals and priorities, (2) visual design system (colors, fonts, spacing), (3) detailed layout + component behavior, (4) interaction states and accessibility, (5) data model and file structure, (6) engineering recommendations (toolkit, packaging), and (7) acceptance criteria & QA checklist.
